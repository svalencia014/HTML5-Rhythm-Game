The goal of this project is to make my first HTML5 game and also make a rhythm game with custom songs. 
So far I just have the repo set up and have not started any development yet.
Right now I am working on the Card Fight Repo and getting that done before starting too much work on this project.
In the mean time you can check out the website I'm Making. The repo is called Vote-for-jazmyne and it is a site using a tiny bit of css and js and mainly HTML.
I would say its pure HTML but we have like one file of JS and one file of CSS.
All updates will be placed here as they are released. Please check out my itch.io (link in profile) where I will post and update my game library as I make and finish different games.
